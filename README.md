# Home_Sales

These are the sources I used to help write my code: google and BCS â€” watching our cloud recordings, using instructor activity solutions and the class activities as references. I also used ChatGPT for guidance and clarification of concepts.

For this challenge, the task is to use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.
